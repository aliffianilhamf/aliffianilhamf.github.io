Selected in the National 50 Best Students at “System AI & Research”, an international research training in the areas of computer science and engineering, information, data, electricity, telecommunications, and related fields in order to increase research capacity at the international level organized by the University of Chicago.

## A Big Step Toward an International Research Career

As a student who aspires to become a Researcher in the international industry, I see this program as a golden opportunity to develop her technical and academic skills in Computer Science. This experience will enrich my knowledge and strengthen the scientific foundation that I have built during my studies at Dian Nuswantoro University. I have very high dreams including I want to continue my studies abroad, I want to become a researcher at a big company (meta, google, nvidia), and by joining this program I hope I can realize my dreams.
